This example demonstrates usage of EclipseLink's JPA support with access to a NoSQL
database, MongoDB.

To run this example you will need:
- ant
- a mongo database
- put jars, eclipselink.jar, persistence.jar, connector.jar, mongo-2.7.2.jar, in this directory
- run "ant" in this directory
- run "ant test" to run the example

The example assume the Mongo database is running locally on the default port, to use another database edit the persisence.xml
